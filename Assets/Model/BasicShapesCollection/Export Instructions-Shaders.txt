 In order to export your creations from unity as an object file you have to follow the following steps:

1_ Create a folder in the project and name it "Editor"

2_ Find the script "EditorObjExporter" and place it in the Folder that you made.

3_ Restart Unity and you will find a new menu item called "Tools"

4_ Select the object that you have created and then go to the "Tools->BasicShapesCollection->Export" menu tool and press one of the three choices. Your new object will be exported to a Folder named "ExportedObj" in your Project, in Documents.


I found the above tool from Unity Community in Wiki: http://wiki.unity3d.com/index.php?title=ObjExporter
